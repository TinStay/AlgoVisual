# AlgoVisual

### Description
AlgoVisual is a single-page application for sorting algorithms which has 3 main sections- visualizer, code and time and space complexity section. 

* The visualizer shows how sorting algorithms divide and sort a list. Users can choose between six different algorithms as well as the number of elements to be sorted and the speed of the animation.
* In the code and explanation section there is a description of every algorithm and code snippets for implementing it in six different programming languages - JavaScript, Python, C#,  C++, Java, Swift.
* In the time and space complexity section a table of big O notation units shows the amount of time and data, it takes to run every algorithm.

### Deployment
The website is deployed to Firebase and can be visited at the following url: https://algovisual-tinstay.web.app/

### Built with
* React- JavaScript library for building the user interfaces using reusable components.
* Bootstrap - HTML, CSS and JS framework used for the desing and style of the website.
* Sass - the preprocessor scripting language for compiling CSS.
